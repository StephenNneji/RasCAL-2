path if a project is opened. Below the title bar is the menu bar and toolbar, which provides access to a number of
operations. At the center of the screen are options for creating or loading a RasCAL project.

.. note:: Some operating systems can change the location and look of title and menu bar.

toolbar will perform its associated action.

Window Management
-----------------
After creating or loading a project, the interface will display 4 sub-windows arranged by default in 2x2 irregular
grid. The sub-windows are

* Plot window (top left)
* Project window (top right)
* Terminal window (bottom left)
* Controls window (bottom right)

These sub-windows can be rearranged by clicking on the title bar of the sub-window and dragging the sub-window. The
sub-window can also be resized, minimised and maximized similar to the main window. It can be useful to make a
sub-window bigger or smaller to suit a workflow, after which the arrangement can be saved by clicking
**Windows > Save Current Window Positions** in the menu, this will make that arrangement the default and RasCAL will
use that saved arrangement whenever the software is started.

If you move a sub-window and want to revert back to you saved arrangement, click **Windows > Reset to Default** in the
menu. If you want to revert to the original arrangement, click **Windows > Tile Windows** then click
**Windows > Save Current Window Positions** in the menu to save the arrangement.


.. note:: The sub-windows cannot be dragged outside the boundary of the main software window but only within the
   centre area of the main window.
