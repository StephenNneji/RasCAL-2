Project Structure
=================
A project in RasCAL-2 is a folder which contains the human-readable json files and other optional files such as
custom files required to run a calculation. A folder based project structure means projects can typically be shared by
copying the project folder.

.. warning:: If you plan to share a project folder with custom files and/or run it on different machines, ensure that
   RasCAL-2 is allowed to copy the custom files if it was outside the project folder (This is the default behaviour),
   otherwise it will use an absolute path which could make the project fail to run.

The primary files in a project folder are:

* A *project.json* containing the model definition for the project.
* A *controls.json* containing the control procedure and configuration.

The project folder could also have:

* An optional *results.json* containing the result of the last run.
* Optional Custom files if RasCAL was allowed to copy them.

Create New Project
------------------
In the startup screen, click the **New Project** button to open the new project dialog. The new project dialog can
also be opened using the shortcut **Ctrl + N** or by clicking **File > New Project** in the main menu.

.. tip:: You can also click the |new| icon on the toolbar.

To create a new project:

1. Type in the name of the project
2. Click the **Browse** button and navigate to the folder which will hold the project. This folder can have
   files in it but must not contain a project already.
3. Click the **Create** button

The new project dialog will close as soon as the project is created.

Load RasCAL-1 Project
---------------------
In the startup screen, click the **Import RasCAL-1 Project** button to open the load RasCAL-1 project dialog. The new
project dialog can also be opened by clicking **File > Open RasCAL-1 Project** in the main menu.

To load a RasCAL-1 project:

1. Click the **Browse** button, navigate to the folder with the RasCAL-1 project, and select the \*.mat file.
2. Click the **Load** button

The load RasCAL-1 project dialog will close as soon as the project is created.

Save a Project
--------------
To save a project, press **Ctrl + S** or click **File > Save** in the main menu.

.. tip:: You can also click the |save| icon on the toolbar.

To save to a different folder, click **File > Save To Folder...** and navigate to the new folder in the file dialog.

Export as Script
----------------
The model definition of a project can be exported as a python script which can modified for further analysis. To export
as a script, click **File > Export as Script...**, navigate to the desired save location in the file dialog, enter a
name for the file and press the **Save** button. The exported script will require the ratapi python package to run so
|install ratapi| in your python environment.

Export Fits
-----------
The resulting data from a fit can be exported for further analysis outside RasCAL-2 or for custom plotting. To export
fits, click **File > Export Fits...**, navigate to the desired save location in the file dialog, enter a name for the
file and press the **Save** button. All the data will be exported to zip which contains several comma separated value
(\*.csv) files, the name of each file will indicate the name of the data, the contrast number and domain number
(if applicable) e.g the file called **sldProfiles_contrast_1_domain_2.csv** is the sldProfiles data for contrast 1 and
domain 2 while **backgrounds_contrast_2.csv** is the background for contrast 2 and all or no specific domain.
